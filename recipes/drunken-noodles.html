<!-- Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe. -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I did have a drink or three while making these drunken noodles, so I could enjoy them as the food gods intended, which is slightly drunk. At least that's the main theory on how this "pad kee mao" dish got its name. It is one of the easiest, and most delicious noodle recipe I know. Serve garnished with Thai basil.</p>
    <p>I always love it when there's some sort of controversy regarding the origins of a recipe's name, and this amazing Drunken Noodles dish fits the bill. One theory is that this spicy, sweet, and very savory bowl of noodles was invented by drunk people, for drunk people. As someone who has enjoyed the occasional late night bowl of noodles to "soak up the alcohol," this origin story makes a lot of sense. It might be unscientific, but it does seem to help.</p>

    <h2>Steps/Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Soak rice noodles in hot water until flexible, 10 to 15 minutes. Occasionally move the noodles around to separate them. Drain the water and cover with a wet paper towel.</li>
        <li>Combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, Asian fish sauce, maple syrup, sugar, and water in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok, or large frying pan, over medium-high heat. Stir-fry shallots, chile peppers, and garlic until shallots are soft, about 2 minutes. Move the mixture around the outside of the pan to create a space and add chicken. Sear for 1 minute, then combine with shallot mixture.</li>
        <li>Add Chinese broccoli stems and stir-fry until tender, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Chinese broccoli leaves and stir-fry until wilted.</li>
        <li>Add drunken noodle sauce and sliced scallions; mix well and cook until sauce begins to simmer.</li>
        <li>Add soaked rice noodles and toss to coat until noodles have absorbed the sauce and are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in Thai basil leaves until wilted. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
